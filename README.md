# Advent of Code
Personal repository for solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) riddles.

## 2021
This year I am using Go to solve the riddles. Please note that I am currently learning Go and therefore experienced Go devs may scream in terror when they look at my code (sorry).

### Execution
```bash
cd 2021
go run .
```
